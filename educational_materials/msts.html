        Mindy the mole wants to dig a network of tunnels connecting all of their secret hideouts. There are a
        set few paths between the secret hideouts that Mindy can choose to possibly include in their tunnel
        system, shown below. However, some portions of the ground are harder to dig than others, and Mindy wants
        to do as little work as possible. In the diagram below, the numbers next to the paths correspond to how
        hard that path is to dig for Mindy.

    <p><b>How can Mindy figure out a tunnel system to connect their secret hideouts while doing minimal work?</b></p>
    <p><b>Extra: Find a valid MST for the graph above using Kruskal's algorithm, then Prims. For Prim's algorithm,
        take A as the start node. In both cases, if there is ever a tie, choose the edge that connects two nodes with
        lower alphabetical order.</b></p>
    <p><b>Extra: Are the above MSTs different or the same? Is there a different tie-breaking scheme that would change
        your answer?</b></p>
