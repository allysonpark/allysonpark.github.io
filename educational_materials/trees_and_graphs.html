    <h4 class="problem-title">A Tree's Take on Graphs</h4>
    <p> Your friend at Stanford has made some statements about graphs, but you believe they are all false. Provide
        counterexamples to each of the statements below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Every graph has one unique MST."</li>
        <li>"No matter what heuristic you use, A* search will always find the correct shortest path."</li>
        <li>"If you add a constant factor to each edge in a graph, Dijkstra's algorithm will return the same shortest paths tree."</li>
    </ul>
