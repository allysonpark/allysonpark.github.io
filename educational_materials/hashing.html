    <h4 class="problem-title">A Side of Hashbrowns</h4>
    <p>We want to map food items to their yumminess. We want to be able to find this information in constant time,
        so we've decided to use java's built-in HashMap class! Here, the key is a <b>String</b> representing the
        food item and the value is an <b>int</b> yumminess rating.
    </p>
    <p>
        For simplicity, let's say that here a <b>String</b>'s hashcode is the first letter's position in the
        alphabet (A = 0, B = 1... Z = 25). For example, the <b>String</b> "hashbrown" starts with "h", and "h"
        is 7th letter in the alphabet (0 indexed), so the hashCode would be 7. Note that in reality, a
        <b>String</b> has a much more complicated <b>hashCode()</b> implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our HashMap will compute the index as the key's hashcode value modulo the number of buckets in our HashMap.
        Assume the initial size is 4 buckets, and we double the size our HashMap as soon as the load factor reaches
        3/4.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> a) Draw what the HashMap would look like after the following operations.</b>
{% highlight java%}
HashMap<Integer, String> hm = new HashMap<>();
hm.put("Hashbrowns", 7);
hm.put("Dim sum", 10);
hm.put("Escargot", 5);
hm.put("Brown bananas", 1);
hm.put("Burritos", 10);
hm.put("Buffalo wings", 8);
hm.put("Banh mi", 9);
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> b) Do you see a potential problem here with the behavior of our hashmap? How could we solve this? </b>
