        <li>What does it mean to sort "in place", and why would we want this?</li>
        <li>What does it mean for a sort to be "stable"? Which sorting algorithms that we have seen are stable?</li>
        <li>Which algorithm would run the fastest on an already sorted list?</li>
        <li>Given any list, what is the ideal pivot for quicksort?</li>
        <li>So far, in class, we've mostly applied our sorts to lists of numbers. In practice, how would we typically
            make sure our sorts can be applied to other types?</li>
