# Nice to meet you!

Hi! I'm Allyson, a software developer at HP, based out of San Diego. 
Though my current role is in full-stack development, I'm open to work in other fields; I love to learn, and I'm quite quick at it too! 
The wide range on my resume--from originally working in biology and genomics to lecturing for Berkeley's 
second-largest computer science class--serves to demonstrate my adaptability and my dynamic nature.

## Resume
Here's a link to my most updated [CV](images/allyson_park_CV_5.24.24.pdf) as of May 2024.

This is me (left) and my dog (right). His headshot is undoubtedly higher quality than mine, but I promise his code is not.
