## Let's get in touch!

For recruiters: I'm currently looking for work opportunities in software engineering. I'm always happy to answer any questions about my resume and can provide references upon request. 

For educational purposes: feel free to shoot me any questions you may have about data structures and algorithms, but please don't ask me about specific assignments! I am also happy to share my advice on navigating a computer science degree program.
