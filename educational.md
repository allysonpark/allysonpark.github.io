# Educational Materials

All the educational content below was created for usage in Berkeley's CS61B: Data Structures and Algorithms. My involvement with the course is as follows:
- [Spring 2020] Academic Intern 
- [Fall 2020] TA
- [Spring 2021] TA, Head of discussion
- [Summer 2021] Instructor/Lecturer for [CS61BL](https://cs61bl.org/su21/). CS61BL is the 8-week summer offering of CS61B. The material covered is mostly the same but there is a larger emphasis on coding assignments.
- [Fall 2021, Spring 2022] TA, Head of homework assignments

## Educational videos
With the exception of the first link below, the _lectures_ I delivered from CS61BL Su21 are the property of the University, and are not publicly available on YouTube. The other videos I delivered are recorded discussion walkthroughs from CS61B Sp21. Each video contains some course announcements, a content review, and then goes over worksheet questions.

## Discussion problems 

These questions for written for CS61B's Discussion questions during Spring 2021. All questions and solutions shown were written by myself and potentially edited/reviewed by other GSIs; parts that were fully written by other individuals have been omitted. The questions may be viewed as PDFs or by clicking the dropdowns below.
